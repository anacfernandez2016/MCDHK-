#McCafe = Center 3

From 2015 McCafe does not construct any combo. No construction is needed for this center.
Combos do exist but they are formed by pressing the drink and they the discounted price food items. 
For example:
Get a Flat White (Item 1) and Add a Croissant (Item 869) at discounted prices. This what they would call a McCafe Combo. From our side
no contruction is need for this combo.
