# Combos and Construction Rules 
From 2015 McCafe does not construct any combos.
Combos do exist but they are formed by pressing the drink key and the discounted key for the food product.

For example:
Get a Flat White (Item 1) and add a Croissant (Item 869) at discounted price. This what they would call a McCafe Combo. From our side
no contruction is need for this combo.
