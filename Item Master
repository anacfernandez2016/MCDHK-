Item Master file from client 
How does IT manipulate this data: 

o	Yes, we do receive the “090ITEM” file from the client. 
	When we import the data that data is put in the MCDHKDL.Dataload.DLItemsImportNew table. 
	We then delete records where the [Item No] column is NULL.
	If there are any duplicate item numbers in that table we pull those out and insert them into MCDHKDL.Dataload.DLItemsNewDups.
	Otherwise we insert the item information into MCDHKDL.Dataload.DLItemsNew.

o	This compares DBO.Items to MCDHKDL.Dataload.DLItems.
o	If we back track this data, it comes from the “Rms-pmix-item-table” file that we receive from the client. 
	When we import the data that data is put in the MCDHKDL.Dataload.DLItemsImport table. 
	We insert the item information into MCDHKDL.Dataload.DLItems.

The main difference is that:
-	the “090Items” file ends up in the MCDHKDL.Dataload.DLItemsNew.
-	the “Rms-pmix-item-table” file ends up in the MCDHKDL.Dataload.DLItems.
